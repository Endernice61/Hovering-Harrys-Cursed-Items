		"" "Allows you to offset items  "
		"" "The offsetter affects items on the same voxel face as other items  "
		"" "Offsetters can be stacked on top of each other to do multiple offsets on the same item  "
		"" "The default settings are by default set to offset 0 units (so nothing) outward from the wall it is placed on"
		"" ""
		"" "* **Button Type** is the direction to offset in, with weighted being the normal of the face (outward), square being perpendicular to the item, and sphere being parallel the item. It will offset in the direction of the red arrow if the blue arrow is facing the same direction of the item (typically the rotation/position handle). The rotation of the offsetter does not matter, it is simply there for convenience. "
		"" "* **Start Deployed** will offset the item in the opposite direction  "
		"" "* **Timer Delay** is the amount of units to offset (0=31), **Start Enabled** will allow using this property"
		"" "* The rest of the properties adds an offset amount, starting at 32 units, then doubling in the amount it offsets the item by with each property, so:"
		"" "* **Start Open**: 32 units (1 tile)"
		"" "* **Start Reversed**: 64 units"
		"" "* **Auto-Drop First Cube**: 128 units (1 voxel)"
		"" "* **Auto-Respawn Cube**: 256 units"
		"" "* **Start Active**: 512 units"
		"" ""
		"" "128 units = 1 voxel, 32 units = 1 tile"
